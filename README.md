# RoomPrepper
A simple script to create folders and a notes file. I use it for Tryhackme and Hackthebox

Before you start make sure that the following directories exist:
~/THM (for TryHackme)
~/HTB (for HackTheBox)

[Changelog:latest]
- added createLists.sh
-> now you can execute createLists.sh to generate a user.lst and password.lst (i.e. for hydra)
- added check for already existing folders of the machine (i.e. HackAllTheThings)
- filled notes.md with examples and changed topics

# Usage:

./start_new_room

# Screen with example input

# When the script is finishing

# The notes beeing opened at the end and they look like this.

# ItÂ´s super handy when you use terminator with split screen layout. So you can start with gobuster and other tools.
