# RoomPrepper
A simple script to create folders and a notes file. I use it for Tryhackme and Hackthebox

Before you start make sure that the following directories exist:
~/THM (for TryHackme)
~/HTB (for HackTheBox)


# Usage:

./start_new_room

# Screen with example input

# When the script is finishing

# The notes beeing opened at the end and they look like this.

# ItÂ´s super handy when you use terminator with split screen layout. So you can start with gobuster and other tools.
